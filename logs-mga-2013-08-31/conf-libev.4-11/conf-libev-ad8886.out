testing for libev: ............................. unavailable

      The following recquired C libraries are missing: libev.
Please install them and retry. If they are installed in a non-standard location, set the environment variables C_INCLUDE_PATH and LIBRARY_PATH accordingly and retry.

For example, if they are installed in /opt/local, you can type:

export C_INCLUDE_PATH=/opt/local/include
export LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/local/lib

To compile without libev support, use ./configure --disable-libev ...
