warning: obuild META search paths and ocaml config mismatch

  The ocamlfind configuration file used doesn't list the ocaml standard library 
  as part of his search paths. something fishy is going on
  You can solve the issue by:
  * pointing OCAMLFIND_CONF environment to the right configuration file
  * making sure that the ocamlfind program in your path is the right one (ocamlfind printconf)

  this is likely to cause various compilation problems
